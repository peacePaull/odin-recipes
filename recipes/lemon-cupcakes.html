    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Zesty and bright, these cupcakes are sure to wow! A vibrant frosting (flavored with a quick homemade jam) sits atop a lemony, moist cupcake studded with colorful berries. Using frozen blueberries makes these cupcakes accessible any time of year, too!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h2>Blueberry Jam:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups frozen blueberries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cupcakes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅔ cup buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups frozen blueberries</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frosting:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine frozen blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice for jam in a small pot over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture has reduced and thickened, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>

        <li>Pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve, pressing solids to extract as much jam as possible; you should have approximately 1/4 cup. Discard any solids and refrigerate jam until completely cool, at least 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>

        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt for cupcakes together in a small bowl.</li>

        <li>Cream sugar and butter together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla until combined. Add flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with buttermilk, beating batter just until combined after each addition; batter will be somewhat thick.</li>

        <li>Place frozen blueberries in a small bowl and toss with flour until coated. Add to the batter and fold to incorporate. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each one 3/4 full.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Check to see if a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, and continue to bake, if needed, for 4 to 8 more minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes more.</li>

        <li>While the cupcakes are cooling, remove blueberry jam from the refrigerator. Measure out 1/4 cup for the frosting and reserve any extra for another use.</li>

        <li>Beat butter for frosting in a large bowl until creamy and smooth. Add 1 cup powdered sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt; beat until thoroughly combined. Add 1/4 cup blueberry jam and mix until combined. Add 1 cup powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Repeat with remaining 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar. Add heavy cream and beat until frosting is smooth and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>

        <li>Frost cooled cupcakes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p>Do not defrost the blueberries before using. Using frozen blueberries chills the cupcake batter more than usual, which results in a slightly longer baking time. Be sure to start checking the cupcakes for doneness after 20 minutes, as bake times may vary.</p>
    <p>Don't use more than 1/4 cup jam in the frosting or it may break (meaning it will look soupy or curdled).</p>
